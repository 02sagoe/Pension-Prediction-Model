# Pension-Prediction-Model

This project implements a model to estimate a person's retirement savings based on various factors affecting their income and savings plan.

## Project Highlights:

Based on the following scenario below. Considering just a basic model for the prediction of future pension payouts

### Scenario

1. Age - 30 
2. Expected Retirement Age - 65
3. Yo have completed your formal education and settled down to plan the rest of your economic life.
4. You desire to obtain a (level) annuity for your 25-year retirement period
5. Annual gross income $50,000
6. Annual income increase at 7% per year
7. Saving Percentage 15% (invested in safe government bonds yielding 6% until retirement.)
8. Upon retirement, your funds in the retirement account will be used to purchase a 25-year annuity (using the same 6% interest rate) to finance a steady consumption annuity

The following outcomes are the result of it:

----------<b>Financial Report</b>----------
<b>Total Income Earned:</b> $7,445,673.0

<b>Total Amount Saved:</b> $2,457,517.69

<b>Annuity Payment Per Year:</b> $192,243.54
